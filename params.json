I am currently performing data science in academia but hope to transfer to industry where I can focus solely on the thing I loved most about graduate school and during my post-doctoral career, exploring and analyzing data using statistical and machine learning methods. I am currently looking for a position in industry as a data scientist. \r\n\r\n### What you'll find here\r\nOn this page I will share analyses that I have performed or that I am currently working on. This is a place for me to store and share my work with others and to grow as a data scientist.\r\n\r\n### About Me\r\nI received my PhD from the University of California, Riverside in cognitive psychology and recently completed the Insight Data Science program in Palo Alto, CA. I love the feeling of digging into a new data set, learning through exploration of data, and hopefully finding something novel. \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you'd like to contact me you can reach me at my [email address](denton.deloss@gmail.com).\r\n",
