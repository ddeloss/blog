<p>This is the personal data science blog of Denton DeLoss. I am a data scientist with experience in studying human behavior, statistics, machine learning, and computer science. In this blog I will share analyses that I have performed or that I am currently working on. This is a place for me to store and share selected data science work with others and to grow as a data scientist. </p>

<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I received my PhD from the University of California, Riverside in cognitive psychology and recently completed the Insight Data Science program in Palo Alto, CA. I thoroughly enjoy digging into a data set, learning through exploration of the data, and making novel discoveries. I worked in industry from 2000-2005 in a combination of customer service, information technology, engineering, and marketing roles. I then transitioned into academia where I continued to build upon the skills that I developed in industry. I also have experience in commercializing academic discoveries and developing their business applications. I have a PhD in cognitive psychology, which gives me a bit more intuition into user behavior and user experience. I also have experience in programming as all of my studies of perception during my acacdemic years were programmed from scratch in a variety of languages. </p>
